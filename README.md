# hello-world
Hi evryone !
This is my first GitHub repository. As GitHub says, I will be using this to store ideas, resources, and share and discuss things with others.
By the way, I am a Chemist and I have worked in several multi-disciplinary projects both in academic and in industry. I am very fasinated about coding. However, I have had fear for it, which makes me nervous about getting on to it. Couple of years ago, I was brave enough to brake the fear and touch on Java. Then, I learned about Data Science and now I am mostly working with python. I don't know what I am going to do yet, but have some few ideas.
